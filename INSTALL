Instructions on installing FLINT
----------------------------------

Building FLINT requires:

* GMP (https://gmplib.org/)
* MPFR (https://mpfr.org/)
* Either of the following build systems:
  * GNU Make together with GNU Autotools
  * CMake (Only recommended for Windows users)

One can install GMP, MPFR, GNU Make and GNU Autotools on a Ubuntu system via

    apt install libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev make autoconf libtool-bin

On a typical Linux or Unix-like system, FLINT can be built and installed as
follows:

    ./bootstrap.sh
    ./configure
    make -j
    make install

We also recommend that you run ``make check`` before installing.

For a complete list of build settings, write

    ./configure --help

An example of a custom configuration command would be

    ./configure                                         \
        --enable-assert                                 \
        --enable-avx2                                   \
        --disable-static                                \
        --with-gmp-include=/home/user1/builds/includes/ \
        --with-gmp-lib=/home/user1/builds/lib/          \
        --with-mpfr=/usr                                \
        --prefix=/home/user1/installations/             \
        CC=clang                                        \
        CFLAGS="-Wall -O3 -march=alderlake"
