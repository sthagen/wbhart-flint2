Instructions on installing FLINT
----------------------------------

If you obtained a tarball of FLINT, you should be able to install FLINT through
the following standard format:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

We also recommend that you run `make check' before installing.  However, this
assumes that GMP and MPFR are already installed in the default search path of
your compiler (e.g. /usr/include/ and /usr/lib/).  If these libraries are not in
such location you must specify where they are by passing their location to
configure `--with-gmp=ABSOLUTE_PATH` for GMP and `--with-mpfr=ABSOLUTE_PATH`
for MPFR.  You can also change other settings.  For a complete list, write

    ./configure --help

The configure script also assumes you wish to install FLINT at the prefix
/usr/local.  If you wish to install the library to another location, you must
pass the path to the location via `--prefix=PATH'.

An example of a custom configuration command would be

    ./configure                                         \
        --enable-assert                                 \
        --with-gmp-include=/home/user1/builds/includes/ \
        --with-gmp-lib=/home/user1/builds/lib/          \
        --with-mpfr=/usr                                \
        --prefix=/home/user1/installations/             \
        CC=clang                                        \
        CFLAGS="-Wall -O3 -march=alderlake"

As mentioned, you can see the full list of options by running

    ./configure --help

However, if you only obtained FLINT directly from source, `configure' should be
missing.  To generate the `configure' file, you also have to run

    ./bootstrap.sh

This assumes that you have `autoconf', `automake' and `libtool' installed.  If
you have installed GMP or MPFR from source, then you should already have these
utilities.

Note that the FLINT building system can handle GMP and MPFR as installed at some
location and as source builds (built from source but not installed).  Though, to
run the FLINT tests, GMP and MPFR needs to be properly installed.
